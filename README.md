<h1>Cool AI Codes</h1>
The idea of this repository is to add problem solving codes with AI techniques, here you can base it on solving a problem or not, it's up to you.

## How is the repository organized?
* Folder `Python` 
* New folders on the way | Loading (...)

Each folder has the respective exercises solved in the language of the nomenclature.

> The files are available on the internet for everyone to consult, however, it is up to the individual to use them or not, as Uncle Ben always says "with great power comes great responsibility".

## Hanói Tower

The `Python/hanoi_tower_bfs.py` file is an implementation of the tower of hanoi using the Best-First (BFS) strategy to solve the problem. 
The `Python/hanoi_tower_dfs.py` file is also an implementation of the tower of hanoi using the Depth-First (DFS) strategy to solve the problem.

There are two execution methods for both files:

```bash
$ python hanoi_tower_bfs.py
...
# python hanoi_tower_bfs.py NUM_DISKS, example:
$ python hanoi_tower_bfs.py 5
$ python hanoi_tower_dfs.py 5

```

The first command will run the program with an interaction menu and will show the number of explored nodes at the end. The second will automatically execute the BFS routine passing the number of desired disks as an argument and at the end it will show the execution time and the number of explored nodes.

Those files is part of a scientific work comparing AI techniques to solve the Hanoi Tower problem.
