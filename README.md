<h1>Cool AI Codes</h1>
The idea of this repository is to add problem solving codes with AI techniques, here you can base it on solving a problem or not, it's up to you.

## How is the repository organized?
* Folder `Python` 
* New folders on the way | Loading (...)

Each folder has the respective exercises solved in the language of the nomenclature.

> The files are available on the internet for everyone to consult, however, it is up to the individual to use them or not, as Uncle Ben always says "with great power comes great responsibility".
